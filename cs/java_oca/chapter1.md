- # Class Declatations and Modifiers 
  - ## Final Classes  
    - The final keyword means the class can't be subclassed. In practice, you'll almost never make a final class.  
    - You should make a final class only if you need an absolute guarantee that none of the methods in that class will ever be overridden
  - ## Abstract Classes  
    - An abstract class can never be instantiated.  
    - *Noticethat the methods marked abstract end in a semicolon rather than curly braces.
