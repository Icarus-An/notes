# Java OOP

## Abstraction, Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

### Abstraction
    Abstraction is a process where you show only "relevant" data and "hide" unnecessary details of an object from the user.
### Encapsulation
    Encapsulation simply means binding object stat(fields) and behavior(methods) together. If you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation.
### Inheritance
    The process by which one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class is called inheritance. Inheritance provides the idea of reusability of code and each sub class defines only those features that are unique to it, rest of the features can be inherited from the parent class.
### Polymorphism
    Polymorphism is a object oriented programming feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways. 

## Stack and Heap
    - Instance variables and objects live on the heap. ( An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks)
    - Local variables live on the stack.

## Garbage Collection
    Garbage collector will only affect the heap memory.
